This application, ColdDetector, was a part of Santa Clara University's "Frugal Innovation
Lab". The purpose of the app is to benefit the homeless with access to smartphones. 
Specifically, the application alerts the homeless who sleep outside. Frequently, when
the homeless fall asleep, the temperature drops without their knowledge, frequently 
causing hypothermia and sickness. Each year, almost 700 homeless in the US die because 
they fall asleep in frigid weather. This application tries to mitigate this impact by 
setting off an alarm whenever the temperature is too cold for the user.

TextBox: The user enters a temperature, any numerical value.

Set: By clicking this button, the user sets the temperature as a standard, meaning that
the temperature should not dip below this value.

Check: Checks the ambient temperature of the phone, the temperature of the GPS location,
and the temperature of the phone. If any of these values are below the temperature set
by the user, an alarm is triggered.

Off: Turns off the alarm.
